# DATA-ANALYTICS-PROJECT
This is a brief insights that I got from the data set (business retails), from the kaggle.
In this project I have performed pre processing of tabular data by imputing the missing values, data cleaning, statistical analysis, descriptive analysis through visualization and exploratory analysis through tabling methods. 
To perform the analysis I have used pandas, numpy, seaborn and plotting libraries.

Outcomes of the project:
The common people are willing to purchase combo packs rather than individual products
General combo products are sold more in numbers compare to gift based combo products
There is a influence of discounts and returns on the sales
The organization has more sales in Baskets product line
